	</header>

	<p>It&#8217;s been nearly five months since my zero faithful blag readers have heard from me. HELLO FAITHFUL READERS.</p>

<p>I guess I&#8217;ve been a bit too busy with work, travel, and work to update.</p>

<p>This site runs Jekyll and I recall that at some point I migrated from vanilla github pages Jekyll to one of those two-branch solutions where I compile the page myself before pushing to master, ensuring that I can actually use 3rd party plugins.</p>

<p>I loaded it up today wondering how on earth I was going to remember how to deploy my site to actually publish this post. Then I looked at my <a href='https://github.com/Kiirani/kiirani.github.com/blob/dev/Rakefile'>Rakefile</a>. I love finding out that I planned ahead&#8230; if only I could remember where I stole half of it from&#8230;</p>

<pre><code>$ rake publish &amp;&amp; git push --all</code></pre>

<p>Thanks, past me!</p>

<p>Anyway.</p>

<p>I could give a long talk about everything I&#8217;ve done since I moved in in August, but it turns out I have photos:</p>
<iframe class='imgur-album' frameborder='0' height='550' src='http://imgur.com/a/oHKPO/embed' width='100%'> </iframe>
<p>I&#8217;m used to the fact that I live in Sydney now. Work is going well, I&#8217;m settled into my apartment and lifestyle.</p>

<p>I still miss my friends and family. I miss my boyfriend, who won&#8217;t move here until July. Mostly life is awesome, I think being a little lonely for a while is the universe trying to keep me balanced.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

		<h2> <a href="/2013/08/20/updates-from-sydney.html">Updates from Sydney</a> </h2>
		<span>posted 20 August 2013</span>
	</header>

	<p>Today I signed the tenancy agreement for my new apartment. It&#8217;s gorgeous &#8212; a sunny little studio at the city end of Glebe, with a raised partition for the bedroom hidden behind a half wall. The walls are covered with artwork: silhouettes of birds, leaves, trees. I&#8217;m in love.</p>

<p>I got to Sydney at 10:30am on the 8th of August. Took a cab from the airport, dropped my bags at the hotel, pulled on a clean shirt and ran straight out the door to go to the office and have a social lunch with my team. <br /> I went from the office to the bank, and activated my account. From the bank to the nearest Optus store, picked up a pre-paid sim card, and finally from there back home to tell everyone my new cell number.</p>

<p>On the Friday I went supermarket shopping, applied for my tax file number, met a friend for lunch. By about 3pm I realised that I&#8217;d run all of the errands set aside for my first weekend.</p>

<p>I was going to start flat hunting in the middle of August. Instead, I went out on the Saturday. My new place is the second of ten that I viewed that day&#8230; The more apartments I looked at, the more I wanted this one.</p>

<p>I submitted my application at about 9pm Sunday evening; by midday Monday, it was accepted.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>So far, working at Google is a lot like attending university.</p>

<p>The first few days are showing up, being given stationery and introductory material. <br /> You&#8217;re told how to find things, what facilities are available on campus, and how to use your email.</p>

<p>The rest of the week, I&#8217;ve shown up at work in the morning and eaten breakfast there, because I was too lazy to have any at home. <br /> I sit at a computer programming for most of the day, surrounded by cool, nerdy people who I can ask for advice, or just generally be social with.</p>

<p>Inevitably, I end up staying longer than I intended and having dinner at work instead of at home. Today was the first day since I started that I&#8217;ve eaten dinner outside of the office.</p>

<p>Like assignments, the first little project I actually have to work on is straightforward &#8212; I&#8217;ve almost finished it. Polishing to do, submission, code review&#8230; And like assignments, I&#8217;m expecting the second project to be exponentially harder.<br /><br /></p>

<p>My job is just like attending university, only the facilities are better, the problems more interesting, and I get paid to be there.<br /> I&#8217;m loving every minute of it :)</p>

	<p>that feeling you get when a new thing almost, almost works&#8230;. you get it right up to the point of working, and for some reason can&#8217;t bring it over the last hurdle</p>

<p>finally, in sheer frustration, you plug in the old thing. the fubared thing. the thing that was breaking everything a few short hours ago</p>

<p>and it works</p>

<p>IT JUST GOES NOW</p>

<p>I need a stiff drink.</p>

		<h2> <a href="/2013/07/08/internet-hell.html">I am in internet hell</a> </h2>
		<span>posted 08 July 2013</span>
	</header>

	<p>I&#8217;m moving in a month.</p>

<p>Before they move my worldly goods, the relocation company has to assess the location where they&#8217;ll be picking my stuff up from, and the volume of stuff they&#8217;ll be picking up.<br /> My tiny apartment is not going to be an appropriate place from which to relocate internationally, so I&#8217;ve moved everything to my parents&#8217; place.</p>

<p>Including myself.<br /> I got here yesterday afternoon, with my things and my computer. Setting that up is doublepluspriority, because I need to use it to work on Monday.</p>

<h3 id='internet_hell_problem_1'>Internet Hell: Problem 1</h3>

<p>Enter Internet Satan, stage left.</p>

<p>First up, the router is at the other end of the house. This shouldn&#8217;t be an issue, because I&#8217;ve had wifi signals cross this house before, no problem. But the router is at the <strong>low</strong> end of the house this time, and I&#8217;m setting up at the <strong>high</strong> end. I set up the desktop, playstation, and my android phone next to each other, and none of them could get a consistent enough signal to actually connect.</p>

<p>Did a bit of hunting around my things, pulled out the best router I own (my little netgear dgn2000) to try and use it as a relay in my bedroom, halfway between the two machines, to boost the signal strength.</p>

<p>Delete two hours of my life trying to get the netgear to play nicely with the rest of the kit; I realised there&#8217;s a phone line right where I needed the relay, and all of the computers in question have wifi cards.</p>

<p>Installed the netgear as the primary router &amp; wireless AP for the house. PS3 and android phone connecting successfully; desktop? Not so much.</p>

<h3 id='internet_hell_problem_2'>Internet Hell: Problem 2</h3>

<p>So I&#8217;ve got a decent enough wireless signal now and I go to connect with the desktop machine.</p>

<p>I get into negotiations with the router and wicd freezes up and hangs, because it&#8217;s trying to run an ifconfig command that&#8217;s also frozen up and hung.</p>

<p>Meanwhile sudo -i no longer works&#8230; In fact sudo anything just hangs, and I can&#8217;t connect to my local mpd server anymore either.</p>

<p>(<a href='http://serverfault.com/a/65373'>Corrupt routing tables?</a> sure, why not&#8230; I&#8217;m too lazy to go back and diagnose the exact mechanism by which the wireless adapter was screwing up my machine)</p>

<p>I shut down the machine and that hangs too, trying to shut off apache, ntpd and samba. Out of frustration I try booting into windows.</p>

<p>I hop onto windows 7 and try to connect to the network from there.</p>

<p>I get into negotiations with the router and&#8230; Actually no, to its credit the windows drivers for the wireless card managed to create <strong>some form of nonfunctioning unidentifiable connection monster</strong> for windows to claim that I was connected to&#8230; I suppose that&#8217;s a better fail case than half the machine freezing up and dying.</p>

<p>By this point I&#8217;ve decided that my little USB wireless adapter has been damaged in the 10 minutes of transit and is malfunctioning at a hardware level&#8230;.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s sleep time, so I&#8217;ll research a new one in the morning.</p>

<h3 id='internet_hell_problem_3'>Internet Hell: Problem 3</h3>

<p>Hopped out of bed this morning and straight onto my laptop to see what I can get in the market of USB wifi dongles, in person, on a Sunday afternoon. In New Zealand. Heh.</p>

<p>Now my connection to the router is dying on me every couple of minutes.</p>

<p>Dying on me as in, the laptop still thinks I&#8217;m connected, the router&#8217;s still taking new connections, but <strong>nothing works anymore.</strong></p>

<p>Okay so this one was just <a href='http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/38145'>interference from another local wireless network</a>. Changed channel, everything&#8217;s fine.</p>

<h3 id='internet_hell_problem_4'>Internet Hell: Problem 4</h3>

<p><em>Hysterical Laughter</em></p>

<p>I went down to pbtech and picked up another asus wifi dongle.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know why I got another one of these; <strong>the one that just broke is an asus usb-n13, and the drivers for it <a href='https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1124701'>cause kernel panics</a> in kernels &gt; 3.3</strong></p>

<p>I think I&#8217;m just a sucker for wireless cards that come with a linux driver on a disc in the box, so I don&#8217;t have to run a twenty metre cable to the box to download drivers.</p>

<p>Anyway, I picked up an N-53 N600&#8230;. thing. It runs on a slightly different driver, so maybe I can upgrade my kernel off of 3.0-LTS now.</p>

<p>Got the dongle installed no problem. One thing to be said for these drivers - if you&#8217;re happy running an ancient, crusty kernel, they&#8217;re great: just compile and go.</p>

<p>&#8230;.. Aaaand my network doesn&#8217;t show up on the scan. I <strong>swear</strong> I had a great signal last night&#8230; Sometime between leaving the house to buy the wifi dongle and now, the router decided to freeze up and stop working.</p>

<p>Reboot the router. Network comes back. Connection stable. Okay. It&#8217;s now 17:08 Sunday evening, but at least I&#8217;ll be able to work tomorow&#8230; Right?</p>
