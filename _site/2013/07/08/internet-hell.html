		<span>posted 08 July 2013</span>

	<p>I&#8217;m moving in a month.</p>

<p>Before they move my worldly goods, the relocation company has to assess the location where they&#8217;ll be picking my stuff up from, and the volume of stuff they&#8217;ll be picking up.<br /> My tiny apartment is not going to be an appropriate place from which to relocate internationally, so I&#8217;ve moved everything to my parents&#8217; place.</p>

<p>Including myself.<br /> I got here yesterday afternoon, with my things and my computer. Setting that up is doublepluspriority, because I need to use it to work on Monday.</p>

<h3 id='internet_hell_problem_1'>Internet Hell: Problem 1</h3>

<p>Enter Internet Satan, stage left.</p>

<p>First up, the router is at the other end of the house. This shouldn&#8217;t be an issue, because I&#8217;ve had wifi signals cross this house before, no problem. But the router is at the <strong>low</strong> end of the house this time, and I&#8217;m setting up at the <strong>high</strong> end. I set up the desktop, playstation, and my android phone next to each other, and none of them could get a consistent enough signal to actually connect.</p>

<p>Did a bit of hunting around my things, pulled out the best router I own (my little netgear dgn2000) to try and use it as a relay in my bedroom, halfway between the two machines, to boost the signal strength.</p>

<p>Delete two hours of my life trying to get the netgear to play nicely with the rest of the kit; I realised there&#8217;s a phone line right where I needed the relay, and all of the computers in question have wifi cards.</p>

<p>Installed the netgear as the primary router &amp; wireless AP for the house. PS3 and android phone connecting successfully; desktop? Not so much.</p>

<h3 id='internet_hell_problem_2'>Internet Hell: Problem 2</h3>

<p>So I&#8217;ve got a decent enough wireless signal now and I go to connect with the desktop machine.</p>

<p>I get into negotiations with the router and wicd freezes up and hangs, because it&#8217;s trying to run an ifconfig command that&#8217;s also frozen up and hung.</p>

<p>Meanwhile sudo -i no longer works&#8230; In fact sudo anything just hangs, and I can&#8217;t connect to my local mpd server anymore either.</p>

<p>(<a href='http://serverfault.com/a/65373'>Corrupt routing tables?</a> sure, why not&#8230; I&#8217;m too lazy to go back and diagnose the exact mechanism by which the wireless adapter was screwing up my machine)</p>

<p>I shut down the machine and that hangs too, trying to shut off apache, ntpd and samba. Out of frustration I try booting into windows.</p>

<p>I hop onto windows 7 and try to connect to the network from there.</p>

<p>I get into negotiations with the router and&#8230; Actually no, to its credit the windows drivers for the wireless card managed to create <strong>some form of nonfunctioning unidentifiable connection monster</strong> for windows to claim that I was connected to&#8230; I suppose that&#8217;s a better fail case than half the machine freezing up and dying.</p>

<p>By this point I&#8217;ve decided that my little USB wireless adapter has been damaged in the 10 minutes of transit and is malfunctioning at a hardware level&#8230;.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s sleep time, so I&#8217;ll research a new one in the morning.</p>

<h3 id='internet_hell_problem_3'>Internet Hell: Problem 3</h3>

<p>Hopped out of bed this morning and straight onto my laptop to see what I can get in the market of USB wifi dongles, in person, on a Sunday afternoon. In New Zealand. Heh.</p>

<p>Now my connection to the router is dying on me every couple of minutes.</p>

<p>Dying on me as in, the laptop still thinks I&#8217;m connected, the router&#8217;s still taking new connections, but <strong>nothing works anymore.</strong></p>

<p>Okay so this one was just <a href='http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/38145'>interference from another local wireless network</a>. Changed channel, everything&#8217;s fine.</p>

<h3 id='internet_hell_problem_4'>Internet Hell: Problem 4</h3>

<p><em>Hysterical Laughter</em></p>

<p>I went down to pbtech and picked up another asus wifi dongle.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know why I got another one of these; <strong>the one that just broke is an asus usb-n13, and the drivers for it <a href='https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1124701'>cause kernel panics</a> in kernels &gt; 3.3</strong></p>

<p>I think I&#8217;m just a sucker for wireless cards that come with a linux driver on a disc in the box, so I don&#8217;t have to run a twenty metre cable to the box to download drivers.</p>

<p>Anyway, I picked up an N-53 N600&#8230;. thing. It runs on a slightly different driver, so maybe I can upgrade my kernel off of 3.0-LTS now.</p>

<p>Got the dongle installed no problem. One thing to be said for these drivers - if you&#8217;re happy running an ancient, crusty kernel, they&#8217;re great: just compile and go.</p>

<p>&#8230;.. Aaaand my network doesn&#8217;t show up on the scan. I <strong>swear</strong> I had a great signal last night&#8230; Sometime between leaving the house to buy the wifi dongle and now, the router decided to freeze up and stop working.</p>

<p>Reboot the router. Network comes back. Connection stable. Okay. It&#8217;s now 17:08 Sunday evening, but at least I&#8217;ll be able to work tomorow&#8230; Right?</p>
