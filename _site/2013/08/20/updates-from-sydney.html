		<h2>Updates from Sydney</h2>
		<span>posted 20 August 2013</span>
	</header>

	<p>Today I signed the tenancy agreement for my new apartment. It&#8217;s gorgeous &#8212; a sunny little studio at the city end of Glebe, with a raised partition for the bedroom hidden behind a half wall. The walls are covered with artwork: silhouettes of birds, leaves, trees. I&#8217;m in love.</p>

<p>I got to Sydney at 10:30am on the 8th of August. Took a cab from the airport, dropped my bags at the hotel, pulled on a clean shirt and ran straight out the door to go to the office and have a social lunch with my team. <br /> I went from the office to the bank, and activated my account. From the bank to the nearest Optus store, picked up a pre-paid sim card, and finally from there back home to tell everyone my new cell number.</p>

<p>On the Friday I went supermarket shopping, applied for my tax file number, met a friend for lunch. By about 3pm I realised that I&#8217;d run all of the errands set aside for my first weekend.</p>

<p>I was going to start flat hunting in the middle of August. Instead, I went out on the Saturday. My new place is the second of ten that I viewed that day&#8230; The more apartments I looked at, the more I wanted this one.</p>

<p>I submitted my application at about 9pm Sunday evening; by midday Monday, it was accepted.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>So far, working at Google is a lot like attending university.</p>

<p>The first few days are showing up, being given stationery and introductory material. <br /> You&#8217;re told how to find things, what facilities are available on campus, and how to use your email.</p>

<p>The rest of the week, I&#8217;ve shown up at work in the morning and eaten breakfast there, because I was too lazy to have any at home. <br /> I sit at a computer programming for most of the day, surrounded by cool, nerdy people who I can ask for advice, or just generally be social with.</p>

<p>Inevitably, I end up staying longer than I intended and having dinner at work instead of at home. Today was the first day since I started that I&#8217;ve eaten dinner outside of the office.</p>

<p>Like assignments, the first little project I actually have to work on is straightforward &#8212; I&#8217;ve almost finished it. Polishing to do, submission, code review&#8230; And like assignments, I&#8217;m expecting the second project to be exponentially harder.<br /><br /></p>

<p>My job is just like attending university, only the facilities are better, the problems more interesting, and I get paid to be there.<br /> I&#8217;m loving every minute of it :)</p>
