It's been nearly five months since my zero faithful blag readers have heard from me.  HELLO FAITHFUL READERS.

I guess I've been a bit too busy with work, travel, and work to update.

This site runs Jekyll and I recall that at some point I migrated from vanilla github pages Jekyll to one of those two-branch solutions where I compile the page myself before pushing to master, ensuring that I can actually use 3rd party plugins.

I loaded it up today wondering how on earth I was going to remember how to deploy my site to actually publish this post.  Then I looked at my [Rakefile](https://github.com/Kiirani/kiirani.github.com/blob/dev/Rakefile).  I love finding out that I planned ahead...  if only I could remember where I stole half of it from...

    $ rake publish && git push --all

Thanks, past me!

Anyway.

I could give a long talk about everything I've done since I moved in in August, but it turns out I have photos:

I'm used to the fact that I live in Sydney now. Work is going well, I'm settled into my apartment and lifestyle. 

I still miss my friends and family.  I miss my boyfriend, who won't move here until July.  Mostly life is awesome, I think being a little lonely for a while is the universe trying to keep me balanced.
