that feeling you get when a new thing almost, almost works.... you get it right up to the point of working, and for some reason can't bring it over the last hurdle

finally, in sheer frustration, you plug in the old thing. the fubared thing. the thing that was breaking everything a few short hours ago

and it works

IT JUST GOES NOW
