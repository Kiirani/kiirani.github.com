Blasphemy ensues.

St Matthew in the City is my local Anglican church. Local as in one block down the road. 

I like to classify myself as an anti-theist, but I have huge amounts of respect for St Matthew's for their classy sense of humour and progressive attitude. It's also a very pretty church, architecturally speaking. 

St Matthew's is <a href="http://www.trademe.co.nz/Browse/Listing.aspx?id=585610950">auctioning their current billboard</a>, which commemorates the marriage equality bill, on trademe.

The Q&A on the auction is hilarious.
