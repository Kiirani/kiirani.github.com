Spending another night unable to sleep; took my pills, read a book, lay down, relaxed.

Eventually become frustrated. Lying in bed tossing and turning isn't productive. 

I get up, fiddle with my website, write some documentation, think about work tomorrow. 

Manage some semblance of exhaustion by 6am... Maybe enough to drop off before 7...   I can't afford to wake up at one in the afternoon after only 6 hours of sleep... again...

I like to think I'm having trouble sleeping because I'm stressed, but then lorazepam, glorious cure of anxiety and creator of unconsciousness, lorazepam doesn't work.  I don't know how to deal with this.
